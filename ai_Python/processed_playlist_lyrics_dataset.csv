Dua Lipa,End Of An Era,"[Intro]
One, two, three, ayy
[Verse 1]
What's it about a kiss that makes me feel like this?
Makes me an optimist, I guess
I always jump too quick, hopin' this one might stick
Hopelessly romantic
[Pre-Chorus]
Then you said, ""Hey,"" and I said, ""Hey
What's your name?""
Come with me
'Cause when I see your face (Ah)
[Chorus]
The sweetest pleasure
I feel like we're gonna be together
This could be the end of an era
Who knows, baby? This could be forever, forever
[Verse 2]
No more ""You're not my type"", no more ""At lеast I tried""
Done with the lonеly nights, I guess
One chapter might be done, God knows I had some fun
New one has just begun
[Pre-Chorus]
You said, ""Hey,"" and I said, ""Hey
What's your name?""
Come with me
'Cause when I see your face (Ah)
[Chorus]
The sweetest pleasure
I feel like we're gonna be together
This could be the end of an era
Who knows, baby? This could be forever, forever
[Post-Chorus]
In the clouds, there she goes
Butterflies, let them flow
'Nother girl falls in love
Another girl leaves the club
Send a big kiss goodbye
To all of the pretty eyes (End of an era)
Another girl falls in love
Another girl leaves the club (Forever)
[Bridge]
I've lost all my senses
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
Is this my happy ending?
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
(Here she goes again)
[Chorus]
The sweetest pleasure
I feel like we're gonna be together
This could be the end of an era
Who knows, baby? This could be forever and ever
[Post-Chorus]
In the clouds, there she goes
Butterflies, let them flow (End of an era)
'Nother girl falls in love
Another girl leaves the club
Send a big kiss goodbye
To all of the pretty eyes (End of an era)
Another girl falls in love
Another girl leaves the club",one two three ayy kiss makes feel like makes optimist guess always jump quick hopin one might stick hopelessly romantic said hey said hey name come cause see face ah sweetest pleasure feel like gonna together could end era knows baby could forever forever re type lеast tried done lonеly nights guess one chapter might done god knows fun new one begun said hey said hey name come cause see face ah sweetest pleasure feel like gonna together could end era knows baby could forever forever clouds goes butterflies let flow nother girl falls love another girl leaves club send big kiss goodbye pretty eyes end era another girl falls love another girl leaves club forever lost senses la la la la la la la la la happy ending la la la la la la la la la goes sweetest pleasure feel like gonna together could end era knows baby could forever ever clouds goes butterflies let flow end era nother girl falls love another girl leaves club send big kiss goodbye pretty eyes end era another girl falls love another girl leaves club

Dua Lipa,Training Season,"[Verse 1]
Are you
Someone that I can give my heart to?
Or just the poison that I'm drawn to?
It can be hard to tell the difference late at night
Play fair
Is that a compass in your nature?
Or are you tricky? 'Cause I've been there
And, baby, I don't need to learn my lesson twice
[Pre-Chorus]
But if you really wanna go there
You should know I
[Chorus]
Need someone to hold me close
Deeper than I've ever known
Whose love feels like a rodeo
Knows just how to take control
When I'm vulnerable
He's straight talking to my soul
Convеrsation overload
Got me feeling vertigo
[Post-Chorus]
Arе you somebody who can go there?
'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya
If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah
'Cause training season's over
(Training season's over)
[Verse 2]
I tried
To see my lovers in a good light
Don't wanna do it just to be nice
Don't wanna have to teach you how to love me right
I hope
It hits me like an arrow
Someone with some potential
Is it too much to ask for?
[Pre-Chorus]
Who understands I
[Chorus]
Need someone to hold me close
Deeper than I've ever known
Whose love feels like a rodeo
Knows just how to take control
When I'm vulnerable
He's straight talking to my soul
Conversation overload
Got me feeling vertigo
[Post-Chorus]
Are you somebody who can go there?
'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya
If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah
'Cause training season's over
[Bridge]
Can you compete? Now is your time
Run when you hear that whistle blow
Are you on my team or stuck on the sidelines
Waiting for someone to tell you to go?
For someone to tell you to go
[Pre-Chorus]
You should know I
[Chorus]
Need someone to hold me close
Deeper than I've ever known
Whose love feels like a rodeo
Knows just how to take control
When I'm vulnerable
He's straight talking to my soul (If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah)
Conversation overload
[Outro]
'Cause training season's over
'Cause training season's over (Training season's over)
Training season's over",someone give heart poison drawn hard tell difference late night play fair compass nature tricky cause baby need learn lesson twice really wanna go know need someone hold close deeper ever known whose love feels like rodeo knows take control vulnerable straight talking soul convеrsation overload got feeling vertigo arе somebody go cause wanna show ya ain let know yeah cause training season training season tried see lovers good light wanna nice wanna teach love right hope hits like arrow someone potential much ask understands need someone hold close deeper ever known whose love feels like rodeo knows take control vulnerable straight talking soul conversation overload got feeling vertigo somebody go cause wanna show ya ain let know yeah cause training season compete time run hear whistle blow team stuck sidelines waiting someone tell go someone tell go know need someone hold close deeper ever known whose love feels like rodeo knows take control vulnerable straight talking soul ain let know yeah conversation overload cause training season cause training season training season training season
Dua Lipa,These Walls,"[Verse 1]
Maybe we should switch careers
'Cause, baby, you know no one beats our poker faces
And when the night ends up in tears
Wake up and we blame it all on being wasted
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, this love is fadin'
So much we're not sayin'
[Chorus]
But if these walls could talk
(They'd say) ""Enough""
(They'd say) ""Give up""
If these walls could talk
(They'd say) ""You know""
(They'd say) ""You're fucked""
It's not supposed to hurt this much
Oh, if these walls could talk
They'd tell us to break up
[Post-Chorus]
(These walls, these walls)
(These walls) 
They'd tell us to break up
(These walls, these walls)
(These walls, these walls)
[Verse 2]
They'd tell us, ""Go and face your fears""
It's getting worse the longer that we stay together
We call it love, but hate it here
Did we really mean it when we said forever?
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, this love is fadin'
So much we're not sayin'
[Chorus]
But if these walls could talk
(They'd say) ""Enough""
(They'd say) ""Give up""
(I know) If these walls could talk
(They'd say) ""You know""
(They'd say) ""You're fucked""
It's not supposed to hurt this much
Oh, if these walls could talk
They'd tell us to break up
[Post-Chorus]
(These walls, these walls)
(These walls) They'd tell us to break up
(These walls, these walls)
(These walls) They'd tell us to break up
[Bridge]
You don't wanna go (Go)
Don't wanna stop (Stop)
Heaven knows I (I)
Don't wanna be the one to cut it off
[Chorus]
But if these walls could talk
(They'd say) ""Enough""
(They'd say) ""Give up"" (Give it up, give it up, give it up)
If these walls could talk
(They'd say) ""You know""

Dua Lipa,Whatcha Doing,"[Intro]
Ooh, na-na-na
Ooh, na-na-na-na
[Verse 1]
After midnight
Me and my thoughts alone
There's a part of me that wants to steal your heart
And a part that tells me, ""Don't""
'Cause I'm no good at givin' up control
Are you worried that I might find somethin' wrong?
'Cause I'm worried that I won't
[Pre-Chorus]
But if control is my religion
And I'm headin' for collision
Lost my 20/20 vision
Please
[Chorus]
Whatcha doin' to me, baby?
I'm scared to death that you might be the one to change me
You're in my head and, now, you're cloudin' my decisions
Got me headin' for collision
Whatcha doin' to me, baby?
Oh, whatcha doin'?
[Verse 2]
In the future
I see you next to me
But I can't shake the feelin' that there's more to life
In the time between

And I'm headin' for collision
Lost my 20/20 vision
Please

Dua Lipa,French Exit,"[Verse 1]
I don't wanna stay till the lights come on
I just can't relate to the words of this love song
What's it gonna take to right all the wrongs?
'Cause, right now, I can't give you what you want
[Refrain]
Everybody's still dancin'
Everybody's holdin' hands and romancin'
Someone's gotta be the last one standin'
And I hate that I'm leaving you stranded
[Pre-Chorus]
But I gotta hit the road
(But I gotta hit the road)
[Chorus]
It's not a broken heart if I don't break it
""Goodbye"" doesn't hurt if I don't say it
And I really hope you'll understand it
Only way to go is a French exit
[Post-Chorus]
French exit
, 
filer à l'anglaise
French exit
[Verse 2]

And I really hope you'll understand it
Only way to go is a French exit
[Bridge]
And you know, you know, you know, you know I'm right
And it's better to do this than say goodbye
And the only, only, only fix is time
And a lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely night
[Chorus]
It's not a broken heart if I don't break it
""Goodbye"" doesn't hurt if I don't say it
(You know, you know, you know, you know I'm right)
And I really hope you'll understand it

Dua Lipa,Falling Forever,"[Intro]
How long? How long?
[Verse 1]
Are you good at holding on?
I know the mind is quick to throw away the moment
Where this takes us, maybe I don't wanna know yet
'Cause for now, you're all I want
They say you got it, then it's gone
I don't believe that every flame has to get colder
I hope the feelings that you give me carry over
Till tomorrow and beyond
[Chorus]
How long, how long
Can it just keep getting better?
Can we keep falling forever?
How long, how long
Can we stay like this together?
Can we keep falling forever?

You could wake up all alone
So tonight, I'll give you something to remember
And eternity's impossible to measure
But it feels right where we are
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm (I'm) falling deep (Falling deep)
Deep in your arms, baby
Baby, I'm yours to keep
Keep me close

Dua Lipa,Anything For Love,"[Intro]
One more time
Go one more time, make you cry again
I'm just sitting— I'm sitting in the middle of all of you
Argh, this is so intense
While Danny eats salted liquorice, that's nice
Okay, all right, let's do it, let's put it down
[Chorus]
And I'm not interested in a love that gives up so easily
I want a love that's set on keeping me
When it hurts, we don't even think to cut it off
And I'm not interested in a heart that doesn't beat for me
I want a mind that meets me equally
When it's hard, it won't evеr feel like it's too much
Remembеr when we used to do anything for love?
[Verse]
We're all so scared of forever
And no one promises always
We're not perfect together
That means we gotta part ways
Remember when
We used to do anything for love? Mm-hm
We're all terrified of heartbreak
Run at first signs of problems
Make it look way too easy
We all got too many options
Remember when (Remember when)
We used to do anything for love? (Anything for love)
[Chorus]
But I'm not interested in a love that gives up so easily
I want a love that's set on keeping me

You were so happy, I could just tell
She's really pretty, I think she's a model
Baby, together, you look hot as hell

And I didn't even want to cry (Oh, what is this feeling?)
Couldn't believe it, had to ask myself why

I must've loved you more than I ever knеw
I'm happy for you

Even the hard parts were all for the best
I see where you're at now, you picked up the pieces
And, then, you gave them to somebody else

You, you, you (I'm happy for you)
You, you, you (Hope you're happy, too)
[Chorus]
Oh, I must've loved you more than I ever knew (Ooh)
(Didn't know I could ever feel)
'Cause I'm happy for you
(Now, I know everything was real)
I'm not mad, I'm not hurt (I'm not mad, I'm not hurt)
You got everything you deserve
Oh, I must've loved you more than I ever knew (Ooh)
I'm happy for you
