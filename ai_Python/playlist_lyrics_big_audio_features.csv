Kanye West,Monster,"[Intro: Justin Vernon]
I shoot the lights out
Hide 'til it's bright out
Oh, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?
[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good bloodsucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles, all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Uh, the best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
Matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple-double, no assists
And my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit
Arguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit
I heard the beat, the same raps that gave the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga, but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, ""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now""
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it ""Malibooyah""
Goddamn, Yeezy always hit 'em with a new style
Know that motherfucker, well, what you gon' do now?
Whatever I wanna do, gosh, it's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So, mami, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ah, put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm livin' in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass",124.887,2,-5.64,1

Just to watch us spiral down the drain?
What if time doеsn't heal a damn thing?

Can you see ourselves in love like this forever?
Or are you afraid that's too much pressure?
[Chorus: Braeden Lemasters]
At the end of the day
I'm not far away, I'm staying
A face in the crowd
When you're not around that's fading
If you wanted I would never call you
Never think about you or never let you go
But at the end of the day
Are we on our way to breaking?
[Verse 2: Braeden Lemasters]
There's a place you used to take me almost twice a week
And at first you made me nervous I could hardly speak

Time on my hands
Falling like sand
Just take it back if you need an escape plan
[Chorus: Braeden Lemasters]
At the end of the day
I'm not far away, I'm staying

So fuckin' serious, you niggas' delirious

I gotta fly out the trappers to sight-see
She wanna fuck wit' a R&B singer
I hit her, I ducked her, I sent her to Nyce B

I'm catchin' pussy like I'm Jerry Rice
I'm catchin' pussy like it was a flight

[Verse 1]
You freed my heart and
Embrace my soul
No one's ever done so
Without your presence, without your hope
The right places feel so wrong
They want me high, but I feel so low
And only you can change that
They miss my smile but I can't let go
I need you in my life, babe

I feel cold and our hate caught in a dream when I'm without you
Stretched out on the ground
Leave me here 'cause I've found my lust without you

You freed my heart and
Embrace my soul

Far away from my home
In this hot-ass town, but my blood's still cold and
Better let them know

None of them felt so soft and kind, and
Hell is a place for what we tried, but
Never felt so wrong in my mind, and
Never understood why

Could it be because our secret's hiding?
I always thought someday you'd find us, but
Waiting for you is like slowly dying

'Cause you kept me warm
You held me close until you let me go
Now my blood is cold
I never had the time to let you know

Santigold,Disparate Youth,"Don’t look ahead there’s stormy weather
Another road block in our way
But if we go, we go together
Our hands are tied here if we stay
Oh, we said our dreams will carry us
And if they don’t fly we will run
Now we push right past to find out
How to win what they all lost
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
We know now we want more
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
A life worth fighting for
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
We know that we want more
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
A life worth fighting for
So let them say we can’t do better
Lay out the rules that we can’t break
They want to sit and watch it wither
Their legacy’s too hard to take
Oh, we said our dreams will carry us
And if they don’t fly we will run
Now we push right past to find out
How to win what they all lost",152.005,1,-4.142,1

The key and the gate, it's a Leanworld
And I’m the kingdom all night, got the key, girl
Splash, splash, splash, so icy like the SeaWorld
Cuts in her arm, here I go, make secrets
And the city still blue, yeah, like the summer was
In my eyes bright lights, you can tell it was
See me going in, baby, you can still have it all
Need the white dress when the night, when the night falls
And you know I want it, I can't hide it (
I have you where I wanted

Can't try, can’t try, can't try, can't deny it
Runnin', runnin' (
Becausе your friend has my friend

Run for the lovе, not here for the violence
And we got each other like bones and blood
And we got each other like brothers in mud
Like brothers in mud

There's a road I know I must go
Even though I tell myself
That road is closed
Like a lonely seabird
You've been away from land too long

To keep me away from you
Aw, from you

Fly home
Seabird, seabird
Fly home

We were so magical, why end this way?
I know you're furious, yeah, just like me

Everybody dies, surprise, surprise
We tell each other lies, sometimes, we try
To make it feel like we might be right
We might not be alone
Be alone

And maybe, in a couple hundred years, they'll find another way

If everybody goes
You'd still be alone

I don't wanna cry, some days I do
But not about you
It's just a lot to think about the world I'm used to
The one I can't get back, at lеast not for a while
I sure have a knack for seein' lifе more like a child
It's not my fault, it's not so wrong to wonder why
Everybody dies
And when will I?

That even when it's time, you might not wanna go
But it's okay to cry and it's alright to fold
But you are not alone
You are not unknown",65.136,7,-17.285,0
