Kanye West,Monster,"[Intro: Justin Vernon]
I shoot the lights out
Hide 'til it's bright out
Oh, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?
[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good bloodsucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles, all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Uh, the best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
Matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple-double, no assists
And my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit
Arguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit
I heard the beat, the same raps that gave the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga, but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, ""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now""
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it ""Malibooyah""
Goddamn, Yeezy always hit 'em with a new style
Know that motherfucker, well, what you gon' do now?
Whatever I wanna do, gosh, it's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So, mami, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ah, put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm livin' in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass
[Chorus: Kanye West & 
Jay Z
]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert (
Yeah
)
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands
[Verse 3: Jay Z]
Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness
Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question, what do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfuckin' monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill a block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and bloodsuckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Millin' about, spillin' they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands
[Verse 4: Nicki Minaj]
Pull up in the monster, automobile gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah, I'm in that Tonka, color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king, but watch the queen conquer
Okay, first things first, I'll eat your brains
Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfuckin' monster do
Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wine it
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really I don't give an F-U-C-K
""Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki, sh-she's fake""
""She on a diet,"" but my pockets eatin' cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am' should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Ah, I'm a motherfuckin' monster
[Outro: Justin Vernon & 
Charlie Wilson
]
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home (
Headed home
)
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide, 'cide (
No
)
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home (
Head home

I, I crossed the limelight (
No, the limelight
)
And I'll, I'll let God decide, 'cide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home

almost monday,sunburn,"[Chorus]
The days we spent were temporary
But you'll always be that sunburn on me
An ice cold shower can't help, baby
'Cause you'll always be that sunburn on me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Verse 1]
California (Yeah, yeah)
Heat waves on ya (Yeah, yeah)
Think we knew that it would go there
Catching magic out of thin air
Warmer weather (Yeah, oh)
Nothing better
'Til we stumble into nightfall
And you end it with a phone call
Why'd I give you my everything
Just to watch us spiral down the drain?
What if time doеsn't heal a damn thing?
And nothing, nothing's gonna wash it away

The days we spеnt were temporary

Aloe vera over my skin (Ouch)
Took you to places that you never been (You never been there)
Why you gotta say goodbye? (Don't say, yeah)
Windows are down on the highway
But you never going my way (Uh)
Burn up in flames like the Fourth of July

Wallows,At the End of the Day,"[Verse 1: Braeden Lemasters]
Please lay your head here on my shoulder
The night is young but we're still getting older
Can you see ourselves in love like this forever?
Or are you afraid that's too much pressure?
[Chorus: Braeden Lemasters]
At the end of the day
I'm not far away, I'm staying
A face in the crowd
When you're not around that's fading
If you wanted I would never call you
Never think about you or never let you go
But at the end of the day
Are we on our way to breaking?
[Verse 2: Braeden Lemasters]
There's a place you used to take me almost twice a week
And at first you made me nervous I could hardly speak
I don't really think about it anymore
Is that a problem or just something to ignore?
Time on my hands
Falling like sand
Just take it back if you need an escape plan
[Chorus: Braeden Lemasters]
At the end of the day
I'm not far away, I'm staying
A face in the crowd
When you're not around that's fading
If you wanted I would never call you
Never think about you or never let you go
But at the end of the day
Are we on our way to breaking?
[Bridge: Braeden Lemasters]
Please, just see
That you are not alone, you are not alone
I'll never let you go unless you want me to
Your words could never be criminal
Mine aren't subliminal
Hope you know
That if it's day or night, if it's day or night
When I look in your eyes, forever sounds alright
Don't blame yourself if they look away
Why fuck with fate?
[Chorus: Braeden Lemasters]
'Cause at the end of the day
I'm not far away, I'm staying
A face in the crowd
When you're not around that's fading
If you wanted I would never call you
Never think about you or never let you go
But at the end of the day
Are we on our way to breaking?"

Double D, big full breasts on my baby
(Yo, we goin' to Florida)
Triple weight
Couldn't weigh the love I've got for the girl
And I just wanna know
Why you ain't been going to work?
Boss ain't workin' you like this
He can't take care of you like this
[Chorus]
Now you're lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost, lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost

Got on my buttercream silk shirt and it's Versace
(There he goes, one of God's own prototypes)
Hand me my triple weight
So I can weigh the work I got on you, girl
(Too weird to live and too rare to die)
No, I don't really wish
I don't wish the titties would show
No, have I ever, have I ever let you get caught? (Oh)
[Chorus]
Lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost, lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost

She's at a stove (Who?)
Can't believe I got her out here cookin' dope (Cookin' dope)
I promise she'll be whippin' meals up for a family of her own some day
Nothin' wrong (Nothin' wrong)
No, nothin' wrong (Ain't nothin' wrong)
With a lie (Ooh)
Nothin' wrong with another short plane ride (Ain't nothin' wrong, ain't nothin' wrong)
Through the sky (Up in the sky)
You and I (Just you and I)

Kings of Leon,Sex on Fire,"[Verse 1]
Lay where you're layin'
Don't make a sound
I know they're watchin'
They're watchin'
All the commotion
The kiddie-like play
It has people talkin'
Talkin'
[Chorus]
You
Your sex is on fire
[Verse 2]
The dark of the alley
The breakin' of day
Head while I'm drivin'
I'm drivin'
Soft lips are open
Them knuckles are pale
Feels like you're dyin'
You're dyin'
[Chorus]
You
Your sex is on fire
Consumed
With what's to transpire
[Verse 3]
Hot as a fever
Rattlin' bones
I could just taste it
Taste it
If it's not forever
If it's just tonight
Oh, we're still the greatest
The greatest, the greatest
[Chorus]
You
Your sex is on fire
You
Your sex is on fire, ah
Consumed
With what's to transpire
And you
Your sex is on fire
Consume
With what's to transpire"
Cage The Elephant,Social Cues,"[Verse 1]
I think it's strange when people say
You're the next big thing, you'll never fade
The slightest touch, forced to fold
Sleight of the hand, modern gold
[Pre-Chorus]
Starry-eyed child left behind
Choose your favorite vice
I don't have the strength to play nice
[Chorus]
Hide me in the back room, tell me when it's over
Don't know if I can play this part much longer
I'll be in the back room, tell me when it's over
Don't know if I can play this part much longer
I don't know if it is right to live this way, yeah
I'll be in the back room, tell me when it's over

[Post-Chorus]
At least you're on the radio, oh
At least you're on the radio, huh
At least you're on the radio, oh
[Verse 2]
Close your eyes, don't be afraid
Take some of these, they'll ease the pain
Live fast, die young, pay the price
The best die young, immortalized
[Pre-Chorus]
Starry-eyed children left behind
To choose their favorite vice
I don't have the strength to think twice
[Chorus]
Hide me in the back room, tell me when it's over
Don't know if I can play this part much longer
I'll be in the back room, tell me when it's over
Don't know if I can play this part much longer

Cannons,Fire for You,"[Verse 1]
I was on fire for you
Where did you go?
I could have died for you
How could you not know?
I was alive with you
But you brought in the cold
Was I being lied to? Wish I never met you
Startin' to regret you

My heart just dropped
Thinkin' about you
The world just stops
When I'm without you

I know I'm being lied to, I just need some time to
Stop thinkin' about you

My heart just dropped
Thinkin' about you

Cage The Elephant,Come a Little Closer,"[Verse 1]
Time shakes, found you at the water
At first you were my father
Now I love you like a brother
Earthquakes shake the dust behind you
This world at times will blind you
Still I know I'll see you there
[Chorus]
Come a little closer, then you'll see
Come on, come on, come on
Things aren't always what they seem to be
Come on, come on, come on
Do you understand the things that you've been seein'?
Come on, come on, come on
Do you understand the things that you've been dreamin'?
Come a little closer, then you'll see
[Verse 2]
Heartbreaks, the heavy worlds upon your shoulders
Will we burn on or just smolder?
Somehow I know I'll find you there
Ooh, you wanna see if you can change it, change it
Still I know I'll see you there

Come a little closer, then you'll see
Come on, come on, come on
Things aren't always what they seem to be

Do you understand the things that you've been dreamin'?
Come a little closer, then you'll see
Come a little closer, then you'll see

Ten thousand people stand alone now
And in the evening the sun sank
Tomorrow it will rise

""Time flies by,"" they all sang along
""Time flies by,"" they all sang along
""Time flies by, by""

Your favorite color's yellow
What if I got you a yellow ferrari?

Before you ask, he already told you who he think he is
Don't try to jail my thoughts and think precincts
I can't be controlled with programs and presets

Don't have to see you to touch you

We know what Hell look like
Still, it's a hell of a life, yikes

I'll pull you in, I pulled you back to
What you need initially
It's just one call away
And you'll leave him, you're loyal to me
But this time, I let you be

And he makes you feel like you should
And all your friends say he's the one
His love for you is true

But does he know the pictures that you keep?
But does he know the reasons that you cry?
Or tell me, does he know where your heart lies?
Where it truly lies
[Interlude]
Yeah
You should be with him, I let you go from time
You should stay with him

Just let it happen, let it happen""

A notion growing inside, now all the others seem shallow
All this running around bearing down on my shoulders
I can hear an alarm, must be morning

It's gonna carry off all that isn't bound
And when it happens, when it happens (I won't be holding on)
So let it happen, let it happen

All this running around, I can't fight it much longer
Something's trying to get out and it's never been closer

But if I never come back, tell my mother I'm sorry

"Tyler, The Creator",BEST INTEREST,"[Verse 1]
Darling, darling, darling
It's no need to worry
It’s just a couple things
(Just a couple things on my brain, you know?)
If it's you and other
It's no need to worry (You don’t have to worry)
'Cause I can sleep between you

I'm a third wheeler

I'm a home wrecker

I was, I was, I was, I was out here playing games
You was out here with a lame one
(I can play the side nigga role easy, but not for too long)
I'm the, I'm the, I'm the, I’m the side nigga
I gotta sneak around and hide with you
I wanna see you, give me five minutes
Paparazzi probably got like five pictures (Click-click-click-click)
(I won't tell anybody, it's our secret)
Top, top, top, top of the morning like yeehaw
I took my shot, this is B-ball, nigga
The team you play for is seesaw
So I know that it's fake when I see y'all
Don't wanna fuck what you got up
I would never blow your spot up
I know my place, I'm the landlord
I'll carry the weight 'til my hands sore
(We can't keep doing this)

I'll keep your, your best interest (It's our secret)
I'll keep your best interest

Billy Idol,Eyes Without A Face,"[Verse 1: Billy Idol]
I'm all out of hope
One more bad break could bring a fall
When I'm far from home
Don't call me on the phone to tell me you're alone

It's easy to tease, but hard to get release

Believing all the lies to keep the dream alive
Now it makes me sad
It makes me mad at truth for loving what was you

[Bridge: Billy Idol]
When you hear the music, you make a dip
Into someone else's pocket, then make a slip
Steal a car and go to Las Vegas
Ooh, the gigolo pool
Hanging out by the state line
Turning holy water into wine
Drinking it down
Oh-oh-oh
I'm on a bus on a psychedelic trip
Reading murder books, trying to stay hip
I'm thinking of you and you're out there, so
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
[Verse 3: Billy Idol]
Now I close my eyes
And I wonder why I don't despise
Now all I can do
Is love what was once so alive and new
But it's gone from your eyes
I'd better realise
[Chorus: Billy Idol & 
Perri Lister

(
Les yeux sans visage

Look at my garage, it's synced up
Get the genie out the bottle and point at any model
(Lama)
What, wait, what? Ayy, what?
Go, Stink, fuck it up, go, Stink, fuck it up
Go, Stink, that's what's up, go, Stink, I'm in love
Hey, boo-boo, too much complexity to learn me from Google
My mama told me that the money outgrew you
My horoscope said I'm really out my noodle
I'm troublin', I'm puzzlin', it's sudoku
Say Bey, yes, America got a problem
Geeked up, choosy love, well, they chose violence
Universal, please don't play possum
I'm a businеss man doin' as follows
Truthfully, I be lyin' in my rap song
'Cause I always fail to mention I'd slap homiе
His career didn't come with no life insurance
Hope his day one fans got some facts on him
I'm an honorary Beyhive, let's see why
Them diamonds don't be fly, they all CGI
You better get it off your chest like breast reduction
If she stressed over you, she stressed for nothin'
Hold up, wait a minute
Even AI gotta practice clonin' Kendrick
The double entendre, the encore remnants
I bop like ten men, the opps need ten men
Billboard, they know (Out for her, ride or else)
After Hov, rightfully so (Bust for else, not us)
Simmer down, I go, I go (Culture, you got us, you got us)
[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Heard you got that D for me
Pray your love is deep for me
I'ma make you go weak for me
Make you wait a whole week for me (For me)
I see you watchin', fiendin'
I know you want it, schemin'
I know you need it, drug lord
You want it on you? Don't I know
You need love, I need some too
Do you want this like it wants you?
[Refrain: Beyoncé]
Know that booty gon' do what it want to
Can't hit it one time, multiple
I know you see these rack-rack-racks on me
Now come and get hi-i-i-i-i-igh
Twenty, forty, eighty out the trap, hit it with the rap
Put it on the map, then we right back
Call me when you wanna get hi-i-i-igh

Baby, come here
I get so lonely at night

Why can't you tell that I'm desperate?
Doesn't it show in my smile?
Why can't you tell that I'm bad for ya?
It doesn't show in your eyes

I wish I was you
So why can't you tell me

Arctic Monkeys,Fireside,"[Verse 1]
I can't explain but I wanna try
There's this image of you and I
And it goes dancing by
In the morning and in the night time
There's all these secrets that I can't keep
Like in my heart there's that hotel suite
And you lived there so long
It's kind of strange now you're gone
[Chorus]
I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good, or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside?
[Verse 2]
There's all those places we used to go
And I suspect you already know
But that place on memory lane you like still looks the same
But something about it's changed
[Chorus]
I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good, or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside?
[Bridge]
And I thought I was yours forever
Or maybe I was mistaken
But I just cannot manage to make it through the day
Without thinking of you lately
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good, or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside?"
Cage The Elephant,Tokyo Smoke,"[Verse 1]
Hey man
Hand me down with the crooked back
What's your father's name? Boy, you don't know where you're at
Pick yourself up, you don't look so good
Maybe you should lay down
Taught me how to fall
But you never told me I was supposed to stay down
[Chorus]
Stick and move
Sharpen up the knife
Keep it tight
Stay between the lines
Make your mark
Take your own advice
Don't be surprised when you trip and stumble
I played the fool again
My old unfaithful friend
Stick and move
Sharpen up the knife
Don't be surprised if you can't stay between the lines
[Verse 2]
Quicksand color blind in the hourglass
All spun out 'cause you can't stop looking back
Better stay still, don't you make a move
What'd you hope to find here?
Taught me how to fall
But you never told me I was meant to die here
[Chorus]
Stick and move
Sharpen up the knife
Keep it tight
Stay between the lines
Make your mark
Take your own advice
Don't be surprised when you trip and stumble
I played the fool again
My old unfaithful friend
Stick and move
Sharpen up the knife
Don't be surprised if you can't stay between the lines
[Outro]
Endless shot rounds
No smoking guns
Fizzled and faded
Now back on the run
My sticks and stones
Tokyo smoke
I played the fool 'til I started to choke
My public smile
My double face
Half in the light
Half in the shade
Need some fresh air
No place tonight
Guess I'll stay in and continue to fight
Lost, trace of trail
Spiderweb spun
Pale white and blue
Now I'm coming undone
Play sticks and stones
Three shades of black
Two steps away
And I can't get back"
J. Cole,No Role Modelz,"[Verse 1]
First things first: rest in peace, Uncle Phil
For real
You the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville
Fulfilled
Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill
Martin Luther King woulda been on Dreamville, talk to a nigga

One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho
Lame niggas can't tell the difference

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
[Verse 2]
No role models, and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night, I was gettin' my feet rubbed by the baddest bitch
Not Trina, but I swear to God
, 
this bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, ""Hey, what's good?
Sorry, I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good""
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, ""Nah, I was the same without it""
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
'Fore I started callin' bitches ""bitches"" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody, you wadn't sweatin' me
[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

I want a real love, dark-skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do', nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt, 'fore she leave
""I'ma need my shirt back"" (Nigga, you know how it go)
[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once... shame on... shame on you
Fool me—can't get fooled again

Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop, bop, bop)
Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop, bop, bop)

My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script, the bitch prolly couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song

Said the lady with the long legs in the lawn chair
She like the strings on my guitar neck and my blonde hair
I write about her thighs in my latest lines
I remember her eyes when I asked her why
Why would you pay for this apartment you don't belong in?
You take this shit from all your bosses and all your boyfriends
I guess I get surprised when you let it slide
But it's no business of mine how you waste your time
Yeah
[Verse 2]
Don't crash, don't text, go renew your tags
No sex, no sleep, just that job
I bet you miss what you had
You can't get no sleep at night
Do you ever wonder why everyone is out to get you every day
Or do you question anything?
How many warnin' signs 'til it hits you, darling?
Gravity's your friend
You fall out of touch sometime
But your history calls you back to it again
Too many factors to be sure
So many reasons to think twice
And nobody asked you to before

Some things don't work
Some things are bound to be
Some things, they hurt
And they tear apart me
You left your diary at my house
And I read those pages, do you really love me, baby?
Some things don't work
Some things are bound to be
Some things, they hurt
And they tear apart me
But I broke my word, and you were bound to see
And I cried at the curb
When you first said, ""Oel ngati kameie""
[Chorus]
Hold on, wait a minute (Oh)
Feel my heart's intention
Hold on, wait a minute
I left my consciousness in the sixth dimension
Left my soul in his vision
Let's go get it, oh, oh
Let's go get it, oh, oh
[Bridge]
Some people like to live
Some just tryin' to get by
Some people like that hurt
Some just rather say goodbye, bye
[Chorus]
Hold on, wait a minute
Feel my heart's intention, oh
Hold on, wait a minute
I left my consciousness in the sixth dimension
Left my soul in his vision
Let's go get it, ah, ah
Let's go get it, ah, ah
(Let's go get it)

What you say to me? I can't hear a thing

Tame Impala,"New Person, Same Old Mistakes","[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
I can just hear them now
""How could you let us down?""
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way 'round
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
One by one, every trait
I tried, but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
Will I be in too deep?
Going with what I always longed for
[Chorus]
Feel like a brand-new person
But you'll make the same old mistakes
Well, I don't care, I'm in love
Stop before it's too late
I know…
Feel like a brand-new person
But you'll make the same old mistakes
I finally know what it's like
(You don't have what it takes)
Stop before it's too late
I know there's too much at stake
Making the same mistakes
And I still don't know why it's happening
Stop while it's not too late
And I still don't know…
[Verse 2]
Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
The point is, I have the right
Not thinkin' in black and white
Thinkin' it's worth the fight
Soon I'll be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for
[Chorus]
Feel like a brand-new person
But you'll make the same old mistakes
Well, I don't care, I'm in love
Stop before it's too late
Feel like a brand-new person
But you'll make the same old mistakes
So how do I know I've gone too far?
(You don't have what it takes)
Stop before it's too late
[Bridge]
Man, I know that it's hard to digest
But maybe your story ain't so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
Man, I know that it's hard to digest
A realization is as good as a guess
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
[Chorus]
Feel like a brand-new person
So, how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction
So, how will I know I've gone too far?
Stop thinking that the only option was…
Feel like a brand-new person
I finally know what it's like
Stop thinking that the only option was…
In a new direction
So how will I know I've gone too far?
Stop thinking that the only option was…
And I know it's hard to describe
Stop thinking that the only option was…
So how will I know that it's right?"
Arctic Monkeys,Why'd You Only Call Me When You're High?,"[Verse 1]
The mirror's image tells me it's home time
But I'm not finished, 'cause you're not by my side
And as I arrived I thought I saw you leavin'
Carryin' your shoes
Decided that once again I was just dreamin'
Of bumpin' into you
[Chorus]
Now, it's three in the mornin'
And I'm tryna' change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message, you reply
""Why'd you only call me when you're high?""
""Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?""
[Verse 2]
Somewhere darker, talkin' the same shite
I need a partner, (High) well are you out tonight?
It's harder and harder to get you to listen
More I get through the gears
Incapable of makin' alright decisions
And having bad ideas
[Chorus]
Now, it's three in the mornin'
And I'm tryna' change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message, you reply (Message, you reply)
""Why'd you only call me when you're high?""
(Why'd you only call me when you're)
""Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?""
[Bridge]
And I can't see you here, wonder where I might
It sort of feels like I'm runnin' out of time
I haven't found all I was hopin' to find
You said you got to be up in the mornin'
Gonna have an early night
And you're startin' to bore me, baby
""Why'd you only call me when you're high?""

""Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?""
""Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?""
""Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?""

I won't ask a question, I'll state the truth
It's everything I know and all I do
And there's people better off, they're just like you
But no one is someone until I tell them who
[Chorus]
This is the way that it is
This is the way that it always will be
Something you love turns to something you miss
Something you say turns to something you mean
This is the way that I know
This is the way and it makes me sick
I feel it inside me like a pulse
It's starting to slow and the meter dips, oh

Why don't you get it? Can't you get it? Understand
They're gonna execute the mother to elevate the man
They're gonna propagate the killer, eliminate the youth
They're gonna blind date everyone until you love them too
They're gonna blind date everyone until you love them too
They're gonna blind date everyone until you love them too
They're gonna blind date everyone until you love them—

I sent you an envelope, came with a poem
You possess venom, that came with a charm
You get the good out me when I perform
I know the bad in you, that's what I want
And you a baddie, you turnin' me on
Fiend for your demons, I know where this goin'
Love when you fuckin' me, talkin', I know what you doin'
Caught up in love, what the fuck is we doin'?
Models and bottles with us, ain't nothin' to it
I tell you, ""I got you,"" that's well understood
Your legs on the bed, got your head on the floor
We go out shoppin' whenever we get bored
We get it poppin', leave nothin' in the store
If I go to Saturn, I know that you goin'
Fuck me on Saturday, early in the mornin'
Flyer than a bird, she gon' open her door
Screamin' out murder, but showin' you remorse
Gotta be cautious, can't pay the support
Stars in the ceilin', don't feel like a Porsche
Came from the trenches, just livin' at war
Once was a prostitute, I can afford you
The one I adore

Hey, is that the truth, or are you talkin' trash?
Is your game M.V.P. like Steve Nash?

You know what I want, and I got what you need

Six summers down, another dreamless night
You're not by my side
Scratch on the moon like a familiar smile
Stained on my mind
Some other town, someone else's life

Made it look easy, we barely even had to try
Ride around town 'til the morning (Yeah)
Braving the breeze as we stare at passing satellites

Got your own reasons to drag it to the bitter end
Talking all night

The Weeknd,After Hours,"[Verse 1]
Thought I almost died in my dream again (Baby, almost died)
Fightin' for my life, I couldn't breathe again
I'm fallin' in too deep (Oh, oh)
Without you, I can't sleep (Fallin' in)
'Cause my heart belongs to you
I'll risk it all for you
I want you next to me
This time, I'll never leave
I wanna share babies
Protection, we won't need
Your body next to me
Is just a memory
I'm fallin' in too deep, oh
Without you, I can't sleep
Insomnia relieve, oh
Talk to me, without you, I can't breathe
[Verse 2]
My darkest hours
Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
Different girls on the floor, distractin' my thoughts of you
I turned into the man I used to be, to be
Put myself to sleep
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me
I just wanted to call you and say, and say
[Chorus]
Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
[Verse 3]
Never comin' down, uh
I was running away from facin' reality, uh
Wastin' all of my time out living my fantasies
Spendin' money to compensate, compensate
'Cause I want you, baby, uh
I be livin' in heaven when I'm inside of you
It was simply a blessing wakin' beside you
I'll never let you down again, again
[Chorus]
Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, yeah
[Bridge]
I know it's all my fault
Made you put down your guard
I know I made you fall
Then said you were wrong for me
I lied to you, I lied to you, I lied to you (To you)
Can't hide the truth, I'd stay with her in spite of you
You did some things that you regret, still ride for you
'Cause this house is not a home
[Chorus]
Without my baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I gave it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
And I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, no"

Daft Punk,Instant Crush (feat. Julian Casablancas),"[Verse 1]
I didn't want to be the one to forget
I thought of everything I'd never regret
A little time with you is all that I get
That's all we need because it's all we can take
One thing I never see the same when you're 'round
I don’t believe in him, his lips on the ground
I wanna take you to that place in the Roche
But no one gives us any time anymore
He asks me once if I'd look in on his dog
You made an offer for it, then you ran off
I got this picture of us kids in my head
And all I hear is the last thing that you said
[Pre-Chorus]
""I listened to your problems, now listen to mine""
I didn't want to anymore, oh-oh-oh
[Chorus]
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
Some more again
[Verse 2]
It didn't matter what they wanted to see
He thought he saw someone that looked just like me
The summer memory that just never dies
We worked too long and hard to give it no time
He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise
He runs his scissors at the seam in the wall
He cannot break it down or else he would fall
One thousand lonely stars hiding in the cold
Take it, oh, I don't wanna sing anymore
[Instrumental Break]

""I listened to your problems, now listen to mine""
I didn't want to anymore, oh-oh-oh

Cannons,Goodbye,"[Verse 1]
I'm just looking out the windowsill
The sun is low, the tide is high
Under the red-moon sky
That's when you said goodbye
And you said
You said you'd save my soul
You said you'd set me free
Don't know what you've done to me
Maybe I, maybe I need you tonight
[Chorus]
Come back and work it out with me
It's plain to see
I need you, but do you need me?
Come back and work it out with me
I'm on my knees
I need you, but do you need me?
[Verse 2]
I'm just looking out the windowsill
The key is lost and so is the high
On that velvet night
That's when we said goodbye
And there was
There's nothing left to see
There's nothing left of me
Don't know how to let you lеave
But maybe I, maybe I'm out of my mind

Miley Cyrus,Malibu,"[Verse 1]
I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catchin' the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand
[Chorus]
But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you (Baby)
[Verse 2]
We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
I'd spend the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us just for a while, do they even exist?
That's when I make a wish to swim away with the fish
'Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song
[Chorus]
But here I am, next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you (Baby)

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
Woah, woah
Every obstacle I overcame
Pushed through it, I ain't pointin' blame
Kept my focus
Every time they tried to hold me back I broke up out they chains
Reached the top and still remained the same
Hit the bottom, get up, no complain
Walk on the stage and they yell my name
They doubt me, but I always do my thing
'Cause they count on me (21)
I got a family to feed (21)
Duckin' the envy and greed (On God)
Street smart, but I still read (On God)
Give birth to heroes, I breed (21)
I smell a win and get tea (21)
Let down the top, feel the breeze (Straight up)
How you gon' give up on me? (On God)
How you just give up on we? (21)
I'd never quit, though
Got a house now, I started with a brick, though
 (Facts)
Say you hungry, all you wanna do is sit, though (Facts)
I'm a leader, I'll show you how to fish, though (21)
If you want it, there's some things you gon' miss, though (21)
I got goals everybody ain't built for (21)
I ain't stoppin' 'til I get what I'm here for (On God)
[Chorus: Don Toliver]
I can't be the one here givin' up
I'm not the one here givin' up (No)
Time heals all, but I can't feel what it was
If you were me, you wouldn't give up
I'm not the one here givin' up (I'm not the one here givin' up)
I'm not the one here givin' up (I'm not the one here givin' up)

Yeah, 2 Chainz
Love me or love me not, link at the gamma spot
Up front, we work, that was a hand-me-down
I wasn't stunned, I'll make 'em stand around
I got a stick with a bandana 'round (Ah)
Never gave up on me, I own your favorite OG
Make your baby OD when she on me
Told him, ""In my time,"" just so you know I ain't lyin'
I bought my whole clique, some new Rollies
Alone, never lonely
Rock with the real, never phony
Do 24 like I'm Kobe
My superhero, was goated
It was the street that had molded me
I got a caught in a web (Web)
I got new thoughts on the head
'Member the floor was the bed
You know I heard what you said
Now when I'm droppin' the top
Don't let that go over your head

Santigold,Disparate Youth,"Don’t look ahead there’s stormy weather
Another road block in our way
But if we go, we go together
Our hands are tied here if we stay
Oh, we said our dreams will carry us
And if they don’t fly we will run
Now we push right past to find out
How to win what they all lost
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
We know now we want more
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
A life worth fighting for
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
We know that we want more
Oh-ah, Oh-ah

So let them say we can’t do better
Lay out the rules that we can’t break
They want to sit and watch it wither
Their legacy’s too hard to take
Oh, we said our dreams will carry us
And if they don’t fly we will run
Now we push right past to find out
How to win what they all lost
Oh-ah, Oh-ah

Eyes it shows
When the beacon breaks, what then
You ask they don’t know
Oh tell me that 
I turn my back, well the
Odds all stand beneath me
And they all said I was misled, but now
The odds all stand beneath me

Alessi Brothers,Seabird,"[Verse 1]
There's a road I know I must go
Even though I tell myself
That road is closed
Like a lonely seabird
You've been away from land too long
Aw, too long
[Verse 2]
I don't listen to the news no more
Like an unwound clock
You just don't seem to care
This world isn't big enough
To keep me away from you
Aw, from you
[Chorus]
Seabird, seabird
Fly home
Seabird, seabird
Fly home
Like a lonely seabird
You've been away from land too long
Aw, too long
Suddenly you're with me
I turn and you're not there
Like a ghost, you haunt me
You find warmth in a 1-night bed
[Verse 3]
Sunsets, full moons
Don't turn you on
Like an untied dog
You just had to run
Like a lonely seabird
You've been away from land too long
Oh, no, too long
Seabird, seabird
Fly home
Seabird, seabird
Fly home

Tove Lo,No One Dies From Love (Extended),"[Verse 1]
We were so magical, why end this way?
I know you're furious, yeah, just like me
You got good reasons, but I do too
What really happened here? I wish I knew
[Pre-Chorus]
It escalated so fast
We yelled things we can’t take back
It escalated too soon
I know what they say, I know that they say that
[Chorus]
No one dies from love
Guess I'll be the first
Will you remember us?
Or are the memories too stained with blood now?
No one dies from love
Guess I'll be the first
Will you remember us?
Or are the memories too stained with blood now?

I tried my best with you, you claim the same
Somehow, we’re strangers, but share this pain
Keep writin' letters I'll never send
Don't want you movin' on when it's my end

It escalated so fast (So fast)
We yelled things we can't take back (Take back)
It escalated too soon
I know what they say, I know that they say that

Guess I'll be the first
Will you remember us?
Or are the memories too stained with blood now?

Last tape was filled up with slaps, I guess gotta run this shit back
Didn't like the way that shit went down at the awards, I admit it, it turned to a beast
This that shit right here that get me goin', after I pop me a piece
Way that we killin' the critics and killin' the hate, might gotta talk to a priest
The way we evolved and knocked down walls, this shit's outrageous (Ooh)
A quarterback calls, I don't like 12, except Tom Brady
Can't short my stock, I still stack tall, you still can't trade me
Storm's a minor but you know she livin' major (
That's right, daddy

Billie Eilish,Everybody Dies,"[Verse 1]
Everybody dies, surprise, surprise
We tell each other lies, sometimes, we try
To make it feel like we might be right
We might not be alone
Be alone
[Verse 2]
""Everybody dies,"" that's what they say
And maybe, in a couple hundred years, they'll find another way
I just wonder why you'd wanna stay
If everybody goes
You'd still be alone
[Verse 3]
I don't wanna cry, some days I do
But not about you
It's just a lot to think about the world I'm used to
The one I can't get back, at lеast not for a while
I sure have a knack for seein' lifе more like a child
It's not my fault, it's not so wrong to wonder why
Everybody dies
And when will I?
[Verse 4]
You oughta know
That even when it's time, you might not wanna go
But it's okay to cry and it's alright to fold
But you are not alone
You are not unknown"
